I have a good gift form God. I always do my best when I do everything. so, when I begin to do something, I can't stop it by myself. This gift help me a lot. but sometimes I'm worried about it. because of it maybe suffer me and bring me pain.

This Night, I went playing basketball with friend Jian Zhou. I desire to get scores very much. so, I runt, shot, do and do, can't stop. In the end, Blisters were raised on my feet. 

ouch, horrible pain...
